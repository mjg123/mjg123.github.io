I received some feedback after my [post on JVM tricks to help Clojure start faster](/2017/10/04/AppCDS-and-Clojure.html) that people were curious about relative performance of Clojure 1.9. I won't go over how to enable CDS, AppCDS and AOT in this post - see the previous post for that stuff - this is just a summary of the results of testing 1.9.

Here's what I found. Y-axis is time taken (normalised, so no units), so smaller is better:

## Headline results

![1.8 is faster, AppCDS helps]( {{ "assets/clojure_18_19_startup.png" | relative_url }} )

  * In all cases *Clojure 1.9 startup is around 20% slower than 1.8*
  * AppCDS really really helps speed it up, and it's easy to do
  * AOT reduces CPU time more than wallclock time - helpful if you're running a lot of JVMs, for sure
  * Obviously, the next question is **why** is 1.9 slower?

## Methodology

### JVM

```shell
⇒ /home/mjg/tools/java/bin/java -version
java version "9"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 9+181)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 9+181, mixed mode)
```

### perf

```shell
⇒ sudo perf -r50 -e cpu-clock $CMD
```

### Clojure 1.8

Invoked with:

```
java -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar clojure.main -e ',,, program ,,,'
```

### Clojure 1.9

Installed as per the "Installation on Linux" instructions from the [1.9 CLI Guide](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). 

**NB1:** For some reason, this gets `beta1` not `beta2` but I assume that performance differences are not significant.

**NB2:** You can use the `clojure` script as I did in the first few examples, but to fiddle with the JVM I found it easier to use:

```
java -cp $CLJ_SCRIPTS/libexec/clojure-scripts-1.9.0-beta1.229.jar clojure.main -e ',,, program ,,,'
```

BTW, it's also possible to add args to JVMs invoked from scripts using [JVM_TOOL_OPTIONS](https://twitter.com/MaximumGilliard/status/919969398949142528).

Great.

## Detailed Results And Notes

### 1.8 plain

```
 Performance counter stats for '/home/mjg/tools/java/bin/java -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar clojure.main -e (println :hello-1.8)' (50 runs):
       1333.399283      cpu-clock (msec)          #    1.486 CPUs utilized            ( +-  0.72% )
       0.897062153 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  1.61% )
```

### 1.9 plain

```
 Performance counter stats for 'clojure -e (println :hello-1.9)' (50 runs):
       1679.680371      cpu-clock (msec)          #    1.573 CPUs utilized            ( +-  0.58% )
       1.067714468 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  0.68% )
```

### 1.8 + CDS

```
 Performance counter stats for '/home/mjg/tools/java/bin/java -Xshare:on -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar clojure.main -e (println :hello-1.8)' (50 runs):
       1307.874733      cpu-clock (msec)          #    1.538 CPUs utilized            ( +-  0.51% )
       0.850517711 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  0.87% )
```

### 1.9 + CDS

```
 Performance counter stats for 'clojure -J-Xshare:on -e (println :hello-1.9)' (50 runs):
       1622.181099      cpu-clock (msec)          #    1.611 CPUs utilized            ( +-  0.58% )
       1.007119652 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  0.62% )
```

The `-J-Xshare:on` arg is definitely being passed down correctly to the JVM. You can check by deleting the `classes.jsa` file and watching it fail.


### 1.8 + AppCDS

```
 Performance counter stats for 'java -Xshare:on -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:SharedArchiveFile=appcds.cache -cp clojure-1.8.0.jar clojure.main -e (println :hello-1.8)' (50 runs):
        720.863677      cpu-clock (msec)          #    1.565 CPUs utilized            ( +-  1.02% )
       0.460565030 seconds time elapsed                                          ( +-  1.30% )
```

### 1.9 + AppCDS

OK I actually got an error when I tried to create the AppCDS cache for Clojure 1.9:

```shell
⇒ java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures \
       -XX:+UseAppCDS \
       -Xshare:dump \
       -XX:SharedClassListFile=appcds-9.classlist \
       -XX:SharedArchiveFile=appcds-9.cache \
       -cp 1.9-scratch/clj-scripts/libexec/clojure-scripts-1.9.0-beta1.229.jar clojure.main -e '(println :hello-clojure)'
Allocated shared space: 50577408 bytes at 0x0000000800000000
Loading classes to share ...
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: 
The shared read write space is not large enough
to preload requested classes. Use -XX:SharedReadWriteSize=<size>
to increase the initial size of shared read write space.
```

(Edit: [Should be fixed in 18.3](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8072061) - thanks [@cl4es](https://twitter.com/cl4es) for the tip-off).

I need to increase the size of that shared read write space, but *to what?!* How big is it by default? Using the very helpful flag `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` we see:

```
   size_t SharedReadWriteSize                      = 10485760                                 {product} {default}
```

I assume that's in bytes, so it's 10mb by default. Give it 20mb with

```
-XX:SharedReadWriteSize=20971520
```

and we're back on track again. Results:
