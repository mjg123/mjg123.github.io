summary:    How to use the FDK and test your Java code
---


Hi there. I wanted to show off some of the work we've done to make it easy to run and test Java code on the *polyglot* FaaS platform announced at Java One this week, [FnProject](http://fnproject.io).

But, instead of just repeating what's in the [README](https://github.com/fnproject/fdk-java#fn-java-functions-developer-kit-fdk) or the [Java FDK docs](https://github.com/fnproject/fdk-java/tree/master/docs), I thought it would be good to do a short screencast showing in real-time how to get started. So, here it is:
