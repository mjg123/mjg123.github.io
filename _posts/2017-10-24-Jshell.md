[`jshell` is a new-in-Java-9 tool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jshell.htm) - a REPL for Java!! I was not sure at first how useful it would
be but since I started playing with it I've been finding more and more uses for it, and it's pretty cool.
There's a couple of surprising things though.

## A quick look

```shell
$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 9
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> 
```

and we're at the REPL prompt. We can do a few totally unsurprising (but neat!) things:

```java
jshell> 1+2
$1 ==> 3

jshell> "Hello".toUpperCase()
$2 ==> "HELLO"
```

There's also a few meta commands, try starting with `/help`

The `$n` are references to the results:

```java
jshell> $2.getClass()
$3 ==> class java.lang.String

jshell> $3.getClass()
$4 ==> class java.lang.Class
```

etc. We can create, modify and replace classes on the fly:

```java
jshell> class Apple{ int banana(){ return 0; } }  // NB comments are OK
|  created class Apple

jshell> class Apple{ int banana(){ return 100; } }
|  modified class Apple

jshell> class Apple{ int banana(){ return 100; } int bigBanana(){ return 1_000_000; } }
|  replaced class Apple
```

Classes are `created` then `modified` or `replaced` when changed. If the change alters a method signature or adds/removes a field then the class is `replaced`, otherwise it is just `modified`. What happens to instances when you do that?

### Modifying a class

Modifying a class alters existing instances:

```jshell
jshell> class Apple{ int banana(){ return 100; } }
|  created class Apple

jshell> Apple a = new Apple()
a ==> Apple@18eed359

jshell> a.banana()
$41 ==> 100

jshell> class Apple{ int banana(){ return 101; } }   // <-- modification
|  modified class Apple

jshell> a.banana()
$43 ==> 101
```

### Replacing a class

Replacing a class nullifies instance references:

```jshell
jshell> class Apple{ int banana(){ return 101; } int bigBanana(){return 10000000;}  }
|  replaced class Apple
|    update replaced variable a, reset to null

jshell> a     // it's not lying!
a ==> null
```

## Semicolon insertion

My inner Douglas-Crockford is bristling at this a bit, to be honest. **Semi-colons are optional**. You might notice
I haven't used any in the code above. The rule seems to be that if an expression *can* be evaluated, then it *will* be. So be careful typing code like:

```java
"Hello".toUpperCase()
       .indexOf("O");
```

Because you'll get this:

```java
jshell> "Hello".toUpperCase()
$47 ==> "HELLO"

jshell>        .indexOf("O");
|  Error:
|  illegal start of expression
|         .indexOf("O");
|
```

I use three ways to cope with this:

  * Everything on one line. Not nice with long lines.
  
```java
jshell> "Hello".toUpperCase().indexOf("O");
$49 ==> 4
```

  * Use the backreferences. Usually only used when I *forget* about semicolon insertion, and accompanied by me kicking myself.
  
```java
jshell> "Hello".toUpperCase()
$51 ==> "HELLO"

jshell> $51.indexOf("O")
$52 ==> 4
```

  * Move your dots. A bit surprising-looking but works OK. Least-worst option IMHO.
  
```java
jshell> "Hello".toUpperCase(). // incomplete expression
   ...> indexOf("O")
$50 ==> 4
```

NB there is [an open bug to prevent this behaviour during multi-line paste](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8190294)

## Pasting content

There seems to be a bug which prevents pasting more than 2 lines of code. It's [reported here](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8182297). That bug is marked as `RESOLVED` but still the bug persists in JDK 9.0.1 which is the latest one (on Linux at least).  The workaround is:

```java
jshell> /edit
```

This launches your `$EDITOR` which you can paste as many lines as you like into, then save & exit and `jshell` evaluates it all.

## Conclusion

jshell is a nice way to play with Java code. Much nicer than creating dummy classes with a `main()` method. Trisha Gee shows us [a nice demo](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/09/java-9-and-intellij-idea/) of how to use jshell from IntelliJ - looks great, and I assume other IDEs have similar support. Try it out :)
