Here in the Bristol (UK) office of Oracle we've had about ten people working on Fn since May 2017. Along with the team members in the US and Ukraine (Hi Denis!) we've had a busy year [LINK TO CHAD'S POST HERE]()!

Most of Fn's code is written in go but many members of the Bristol team weren't used to it - most of our previous projects were Clojure or Java. So there was a learning curve. Some expectations were met, and some were dashed. And being developers we enjoyed vocally complaining. Barely a day would go by without someone crying out

> How do I do generics!?

or

> This PR has 10000s of lines changed? Ohhhh.....

or even

> TABS !!?!?!!

Now - please don't think this post is going to be a ranty screed about how golang is terrible or anything like that. We're all grownup enough to know that it's a just tool and like any other it's perfectly capable if used in the right way, even if we do like a good moan from time to time. So, we decided to create: The Golang Swear Jar.

![SwearBox]({{ "assets/swearbox_sm.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Every time some poor soul had an expectation/reality-mismatch they could simply drop 10p in the jar and be on their way.

And now, it's the end of the year and the jar is actually *full*. We've cracked it open, counted it, gotten Oracle to match the amount a few times over and round it up, and we're donating to charity (details TBC)

## What made us swear

The jar had a space on the back where you could write down what you were complaining about:

![swear-o-gram]({{ "assets/swearing.png" | absolute_url }})

Anyway - happy holidays, see you for more serverless Fn in the new year!
