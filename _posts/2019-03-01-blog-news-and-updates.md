Hello everyone! I am delighted to say that I've accepted a job with [Twilio](https://twilio.com) as a [Developer Evangelist](https://www.twilio.com/blog/introducing-developer-evangelist-matthew-gilliard) for the Java and JVM-language communities.

I may update this blog from time to time with personal posts, but anything I write about Java will be on the [Twilio Blog](https://twilio.com/blog/author/mgilliard). I'm looking forward to learning, teaching and helping as many of you as I can.
