The office I work in has a diversity problem. Specifically around age and experience: we used to heavily recruit for "more experienced engineers" ([hmm](https://twitter.com/mnowster/status/954673462743838721)). Recently we took the chance to reflect on our demographics and decided to hire several junior engineers. We were able to get several applicants through outreach to universities, internships, meetups and the hard work of our recruitment team (thanks Mike!) but this post isn't about that. It's about the _next_ problem: **how to support junior engineers when they start working with us?**

We want new starters to feel welcomed and comfortable, and we want them to be able to grow into wonderfully productive and happy colleagues. The most important output of the best senior engineers is more excellent engineers. But we have _little-to-no experience_ of how this actually happens. Therefore our first step was to think about what the needs and wishes of a new starter are, and make sure that we had some way of ensuring that those needs would be met.

This post describes how we did that, and what we discovered. Some of it is naturally specific to our situation (3 dev teams, cloud infrastructure work) and some is probably useful to any team. I found that there was not much information online on this topic so I hope my writeup here is helpful.

## Brainstorming

After a brief mention in our weekly huddle, we found a half-dozen interested people (including, happily enough, our 2 most recent hires) and ran a 1-hour [diverge and converge](http://creativeemergence.typepad.com/the_fertile_unknown/2010/02/creative-thinking-diverge-and-converge.html) meeting.

![diverge and converge]({{ "assets/new_starter_meeting.jpg" | relative_url }})

Our first objective: **What does a new starter need?**

 - **before they start**
 - **on day 1**
 - **in their first week**
 - **in their first month**
 - **in their first year**
 
 Also: **what new-starter antipatterns should we avoid?**

This generated *a lot* of ideas. So we merged them into similar groups and considered the question from another angle: **What roles need to exist to make sure that the starter's needs are met?**

We identified 6 independent roles, and made sure that each of the needs would be naturally met by a person in one of the roles. A few important notes:

 - People in each role are identified *before* the new starter joins
 - Roles are independent, but multiple roles could be filled by the same individual
 - The person in a particular role is _not_ responsible for meeting each of the needs in that role. They _are_ responsible for noticing whether the needs are being met and providing help if necessary.

So, what did we find?

### Onboarding buddy

The onboarding buddy is usually expected to be the most recent new starter.

  - **Before they start**
    + Make sure the new-starter checklist is up-to-date (this says how to check SSO/access email/setup VPN etc)
  - **Day 1**
    + Introduce and explain the new-starter checklist
  - **Week 1**
    + Orientation of internal systems: here's how to request holiday etc
	+ Complete any mandatory HR items
  - **First month**
    + New starter checklist is complete
  - **First year**
    + Support when they are someone else's onboarding buddy


### Social buddy

Maybe best if it's someone from a different team. If the new starter already knows someone then so much the better.

  - **Day 1**
    + Introductions to people around the office
	+ Get everyone to go to lunch together
  - **Week 1**
    + Do people hang out after work? Invite the new starter
	+ Explain where the best coffee is bought from
    + Go to Brewdog
    + Play foos and pool
  - **First year**
    + Make sure there are more social events (karting, bowling, gin-tasting, etc)

### Manager

AKA career mentor

  - **Before they start**
    + Decide who the manager is (this hasn't always happened here!), introduce yourself by email.
    + Send out a day 1 itinerary. What time to arrive? What to bring?
	+ If multiple new starters are starting together (eg intern groups) connect them with each other
  - **Day 1**
    + Is physically present when the new starter arrives. If not possible due to travel/illness/vacation/etc, has delegated all day 1 activities cleanly.
	+ Introduce to other supporters (social buddy etc)
    + Inform if anything important is happening today (visitors, all-hands, etc)
    + Tour of the office. Fire escapes.
	+ Knows which team the starter will join initially.
  - **Week 1**
    + Explain what projects are happening in the office. Both the technical teams and the university/startup outreach teams.
  - **First month**
    + Frequent 1-1s
	+ Up to this point, new starters should not have had to care about politics/deadlines/other corporate stuff. Start to introduce it now.
	+ (flipside of the above) Start to widen their network outside of co-located teams.
	+ Training/learning needs identified. Show O'Reilly bookshelf, find external courses/MOOCs if necessary.
  - **First year**
    + Weekly 1-1s
	+ They have worked on several different teams
    + Ensure increasing levels of responsibility/autonomy/independence/trust.
	+ Ask if they can join the hiring/interviewing teams
	+ Get involved with meetups/conference speaker/uni visits (if wanted)
	+ Progressive targets & encourage setting of own targets
	+ Broad understanding of several work areas. Contributions to a subset of that.
    + Starter still works here. Or, if it's genuinely not working out, make sure there is a clear understanding of why not and possibly help with further career goals outside of our company.

### HR/Admin team

  - **Before they start**
    + Requests hardware (laptops etc) with enough lead-time
	+ Request accounts on HR systems etc
    + Building pass

### Team buddy

This is someone on the dev team they are initially joining

  - **Before they start**
    + Some advice on background reading for that team's work.
  - **Day 1**
    + Empty and clean desk is available. Within the team space, not isolated.
	+ Help dealing with the monitor stands, unboxing laptop.
	+ What slack channels should they join (apart from #fooz of course)
	+ Commit some code (as part of a pair, probably)!
  - **Week 1**
    + Ensure the team goals are understood, also who is working on what.
	+ Provide help with dev processes (source-control, CI, IDE, communication tools etc)
	+ Provide a well-defined concrete task (again, as part of a pair is fine)
  - **First month**
    + Ensure integration into everything the team does together
  - **First year**
    + Starter been to an external conference (ideally with the team)
	+ Starter is delivering/contributing regularly

### The new starter

Oh yes, they have some responsibilty for their own destiny!

  - **Before they start**
    + Chill out!
  - **Day 1**
    + Go with the flow. Stay chilled.
  - **Week 1**
    + Continue being relaxed.
    + Knows everyone on their team and be comfortable interrupting anyone
    + Is asking lots of questions
	+ Identify areas for self-study
  - **First month**
    + Be ready to be someone else's onboarding buddy
    + Articulate some personal goals for the next few months
    + Decide which of the teams areas of work is most interesting and move toward it.
    + Actively contributing to a project.
    + Has done a demo on behalf of their team, to the other teams.
	+ Gives feedback on the new-starter process.
  - **First year**
    + Is setting own goals and tracking progress effectively


## Antipatterns

![New starter antipatterns]({{ "assets/new_starter_antipatterns.jpg" | relative_url }})

 - Not enough time spent with the starter:
   + "Here's the wiki"
   + "Go and look at this and come back if you have any questions"
   + Being thrown in at the deep end
 - Mandatory Training overload
 - No code/commits in "live"
 - Not making enough time and energy for the starter:
   + Everyone is too busy to interrupt
   + Cynical/negative colleagues
 - "Need to know" access to accounts
 - Not ensuring that people who have responsibilites toward a new starter are actually able do them
   + Untrained/inexperienced buddies
   + Being overpowered/forced to learn at someone else's pace
   
 That last one is very important - there *must* be support and training for the people in the roles outlined above otherwise it will be bad for everyone.


## Summary

We felt positive at the end of this meeting. I would absolutely appreciate your advice and insights. New starters due soon and we're super-excited about it!
