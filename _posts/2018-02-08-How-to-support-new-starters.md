The office I work in has a diversity problem. Specifically around age and experience: we used to heavily recruit for older and more experienced engineers. Recently we took the chance to reflect on our demographic and decided to hire several junior engineers. We were able to get several applicants through outreach to universities, internships, meetups and the hard work of our recruitment team (thanks Mike!) but this post isn't about that. It's about the _next_ problem: **how to support junior engineers when they start working with us?**

We want new starters to feel welcomed and comfortable, and we want them to be able to grow into wonderfully productive and happy colleagues. The most important output of the best senior engineers is more excellent engineers. But we have _little-to-no experience_ of how to actually make this happen. Therefore our first step was to think about what the needs and wishes of a new starter are, and make sure that we had some way of ensuring that those needs would be met.

## Brainstorming

After a brief mention in our weekly huddle, we found a half-dozen interested people (including, happily enough, our 2 most recent hires) and ran a 1-hour [TODO: link! diverge-and-merge]() meeting.

TODO: photo here.

**What does new starter need?**

 - **before they start**
 - **on day 1**
 - **in their first week**
 - **in their first month**
 - **in their first year**
 
 Also: **what are the new-starter antipatterns?**

This generated *a lot* of ideas. So we merged them into similar groups and considered the question from another angle: **What roles need to exist to make sure that the starter's needs are met?**

We identified 6 independent roles, and made sure that each of the needs would be naturally met by the person in that role. A few important notes:

 - People in each role are identified *before* the new starter joins
 - Roles are independent, but multiple roles could be done by the same individual
 - The person in a particular role is _not_ responsibly for meeting each of the needs in that role. They _are_ responsible for noticing whether the needs are being met and providing help if necessary.

## Decisions decisions

So, the roles & responsibilities we discovered:

### Onboarding buddy

The onboarding buddy is expected to be usually be the most-recent new starter.

  - **Before they start**
    + Make sure the new-starter checklist is up-to-date (this details how to check SSO/access email/setup VPN etc)
  - **Day 1**
    + Walk through the new-starter checklist
  - **Week 1**
    + Orientation of internal systems: here's our git-server, here's how to request holiday etc
	+ Complete any mandatory HR videos
  - **First month**
    + New starter checklist is complete
  - **First year**
    + Support when they are someone else's onboarding buddy


### Social buddy

Maybe best to be someone from a different team (we currently have 3 dev teams). If they already know someone here from somewhere else then so much the better.

  - **Day 1**
    + Introductions to people around the office
	+ Get everyone to go to lunch together
  - **Week 1**
    + Do people hang out after work? Invite the new starter.
    + Go to Brewdog
    + Play foos and pool
  - **First year**
    + Make sure there are more social events (karting, bowling, gin-tasting, etc)

### Manager

AKA career mentor

  - **Before they start**
    + Decide who the manager is (this hasn't always happened here!) And introduce yourself by email.
    + Send out a day 1 itinerary. What is the starter expected to bring with them?
	+ If multiple new starters are starting together (eg intern groups) connect them with each other
  - **Day 1**
    + Is physically present if possible when the new starter arrives. If not possible, has delegated all day 1 activities clearly.
	+ Introduce to other supporters (social buddy etc)
    + Inform if anything important is happening today (visitors, all-hands, etc)
    + Tour of the office. Fire escapes.
	+ Knows which team the starter will join initially.
  - **Week 1**
    + Know what projects are happening in the office. Both the technical teams and the university/startup outreach teams.
  - **First month**
    + Frequent 1-1s
	+ Up to this point, they should not have had to care about politics/deadlines/other corporate stuff. Start to introduce it now.
	+ Training/learning needs identified. Show O'Reilly bookshelf, find external courses/MOOCs if necessary.
  - **First year**
    + Weekly 1-1s
    + Increase their level of responsibility/autonomy/independence/trust.
	+ Join the hiring/interviewing teams
	+ Get involved with meetups/conference speaker/uni visits (if wanted)
	+ Progressive targets & setting of own targets
	+ Broad understanding of several work areas. Contributions to a subset of that.
    + Still works here. Or, if it's genuinely not working out, make sure there is a clear understanding of why not and possibly help with further career goals outside of our company.
	+ Has worked on several different teams

### HR/Admin team

  - **Before they start**
    + Requests hardware (laptops etc) with enough lead-time
	+ Request accounts on HR systems etc
    + Building pass

### Team buddy

This is for the dev team they are joining

  - **Before they start**
    + Some advice on background reading for that team's work. Eg k8s or whatever.
  - **Day 1**
    + Empty and clean desk is available. Within the team space, not isolated.
	+ What slack channels should they join (apart from #fooz of course)
	+ Commit some code (as part of a pair, probably)!
  - **Week 1**
    + Knows the team goals and who is working on what.
	+ Understand dev processes (source-control, CI, IDE, communication channels etc)
	+ Has a concrete task (again, as part of a pair is fine)
  - **First month**
    + Is integrated into the team
  - **First year**
    + Has been to a conference (ideally with the team)
	+ Is delivering regularly

### The new starter

Oh yes, they have some responsibilty for their own destiny!

  - **Before they start**
    + Chill out!
  - **Day 1**
  - **Week 1**
    + Knows everyone on their team/is comfortable interrupting anyone
    + Is asking lots of questions
	+ Identify areas for self-study
  - **First month**
    + Be ready to be someone else's onboarding buddy
    + Articulate some personal goals
    + Decide which of the teams areas of work is most interesting and move toward it.
    + Actively contributing to a project.
    + Has done a demo on behalf of their team, to the other teams.
  - **First year**
    + Is setting own goals and tracking progress effectively
