# Baby Gilliard dreams of travel

Even from a young age I was always interested in travel. Some of my best early memories are of playing with other kids on a campsite in France, having fun even though we couldn't speak each others' language. Despite getting my best grades in maths and sciences I kept up studying languages so that I would one day be able to work abroad, and I even started off at university on a joint-honours course of Engineering with French.

# Grows up, the dream fades...

Several years later, though, I graduated with a degree in mathematics (no French) and although I didn't find a good opportunity to work abroad straight away I still often dreamed of it. I got a job as a programmer and worked for a few years on projects for different clients. I learned that I actually enjoyed working with software and with software people, and what's more I seemed to have a knack for it. So I let my travelling dreams fade for a while as I absorbed what I could about the industry.

# ...and comes back!

That all changed when I met a Japanese woman who was working in the UK and we became good friends (spoiler alert: we've been married over a decade now). It didn't take much effort for her to persuade me to apply for the JET programme. This is a scheme where graduates from English-speaking countries can work in Japanese public schools for a few years as Assistant Language Teachers. I'd been lucky enough to work with some great people in my tech career so far - I was an apprentice in Agile, TDD, distributed apps -  but this was too good a chance to pass up. So I said my farewells and started studying the art of teaching English.

Immediately I learned two big things:
  - Getting over my shyness and fear of public speaking was mandatory
  - Being able to do something well (ie speak English) does not naturally translate to being able to teach someone else to do it well

Soon, with my Cambridge English Teachers certificate in-hand, I arrived at Inagakuen Public High School in Saitama Japan for what turned out to be 3 of the best years. Much fun was had doing all kinds of things, but the most rewarding part was being able to help these kids get better at speaking English while improving my own skills as a teacher. They wanted to learn and to improve, and it was my job to create an environment where they could.

After my JET contract had expired, I knew I would have to switch back to working in IT. By this time we were married with a child. English teaching in Japan, while fun, is not a job that pays well enough to easily support a family of 3. I also missed the technical challenges of programming and was jealous of some of the cool stuff my friends were working on. This was 2009 - there was a Cambrian explosion of cloud and internet services going on which I wanted to be part of.

# End of that chapter

So we moved back to the UK - I got another job in software, worked for a few companies, learned more about Java and the JVM and began to specialize in it. I was an early adopter of Clojure and was able to use it professionally for a while. I worked on HP's OpenStack-based public cloud (RIP). But I never found anything in programming which replaced the joy I had gotten from helping people learn and imrpove their own skills.  The closest I got was the occasional talk at a meetup or a conference. For a few years I ran BrisFunctional (Bristol's worst (only) Functional Programming Club) which was really a free-for-all interesting tech meetup that was a lot of fun to be part of.

Now I work at Oracle, and more through luck than my good judgement I started working on an Open-Source project - Fn - and I could see that there was an opportunity to try to recapture my lost love of working hard to help other people learn to do things they otherwise couldn't. I really think that the 10x engineer is the one who makes 10 other engineers better.

In this case the topics are Fn, Serverless and Java rather than English. I can finally combine both of the things which I've enjoyed most in my career: teaching and learning with others, and gnarly cloud-infrastructure programming - and considering that I get to travel a lot and meet new people it's been a great career move for me. Since Fn was announced at Openworld 2017 I have been working somewhere between 90-100% on DevRel. I don't get to do as much programming as I like any more but as I practise and improve my time-management skills I hope to be able to.

# Support and role models.

But, honestly, I don't think I would have been able to make the decision to do that without a couple of groups of people. Firstly role-models - thanks to his excellent book Apprenticeship Patterns I had met Ade Oshineye a few years ago, which I believe was the first time I became aware of the possibility of a job in dev advocacy. I am a big fan of how Trisha Gee keeps consistently creating such useful material, and recently the influx of excellent advocates to Azure has been great source of inspiration too.  I also need to credit the people who have supported and encouraged me at Oracle - Martin Thom and Chad.

So, that's why I work in Developer Relations. How about you?
