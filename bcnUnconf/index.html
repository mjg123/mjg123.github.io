  <h2 name="unconf">About the unconference</h2>
  
<p>We are delighted to be hosting the first Bristol Cloud Native Unconference on <em>November xx 2018</em>.</p>

<p>The unconference exists so that people who work with cloud technology in any role and with any level of experience can come together for an event full of discussions, learning and spending time with peers.</p>

<p>The unconference format has been used with great success in many other events such as LJC Unconference, JCrete and JManc.</p>

<h2>What is an Unconference?</h2>

<p>The unconference format does not follow usual conference norms. All the scheduled slots start out empty, and <em>you</em> decide what to talk about and which topics to discuss. No separations and made between "speakers" and "audience" - everyone is encouraged to use their unique set of skills and experience to participate equally.</p>

<p>The schedule is generated on the fly by suggestions from participants, merging similar suggestions and voting on popularity. Whether you are an expert, and learner or simply confused about something you are encouraged to start a conversation about anything.</p>

<p>When you propose a session topic you are <em>not</em> expected to stand up and talk to the crowd. You do not need slides, presentation materials nor witty jokes. People who have chosen to attend your session have done so because they are interested in it. You might want to spend the first 5 minutes explaining why you thought the topic would be interesting and asking others the same question - the rest is up to you and the others.</p>

<p>Because the unconference is designed to seed, facilitate and encourage conversations between the attendees we are providing some social activities (TODO MORE HERE with details) - feel free to make full use of everything that is provided.</p>

  <h3>Some Principles and a Law</h3>

  The unconference format is loosely based on the Open Space Technology (TODO:Link) format, so we use the following principles:

  <dl>
    <dt>Whoever comes are the right people</dt>
    <dd>reminds participants that they don't need the CEO and 100 people to get something done, you need people who care. And, absent the direction or control exerted in a traditional meeting, that's who shows up in the various breakout sessions.</dd>

    <dt>Whenever it starts is the right time</dt>
    <dd>reminds participants that spirit and creativity do not run on the clock</dd>

    <dt>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</dt>
    <dd>reminds participants that once something has happened it is done. And that anything not done does not happen. If you wish to see something happen, just do it.</dd>

    <dt>Wherever it happens is the right place</dt>
    <dd>reminds participants that space is open everywhere all the time. Conversations can and should happen any place and any time - and please show each other the same respect, wherever you are</dd>
    
    <dt>When it's over, it's over</dt>
    <dd>reminds participants that we never know how long it will take. When the conversation is finished then move on to the next. Do the work, not the time.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h4>The Law of Two Feet</h4>
  
  We have only one "law" - <em>The Law of Two Feet</em>:

  <blockquote>
    If at any time you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing: use your two feet and go someplace else.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Don't waste your time. Move around, cross-pollinate groups and be open to those chance encounters which can bring out the most creative of discussions.</p>

  <p>The unconference is there to serve <em>you</em> and it is <em>you</em> who has the ability to make it the event you wish to attend.</p>

  <h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>TODO: Setup EventBrite or Meetup thing for this.</p>
<p>If we are oversubscribed then attendees will be chosen by ballot - When?</p>
<p>Would like to ensure that this is an event which encourages diversity, so can we have some questions like: Do you consider yourself to be part of an underrepresented group in technology (if you are not sure what this question means or why it is important, please see XXXXX find good link here)? Are you currently based in Bristol? How many years have you been working in or studying cloud technology?</p>
