![My Face]({{ "assets/gilliard.jpg" | absolute_url }})

This is what I look like. I work for Oracle in Bristol (UK) on Open-Source, Java and Serverless/Cloud infrastructure. Opinions and comments are my own.

I love speaking and teaching and am looking for opportunities to do more of it. [Here's why]({% post_url 2018-06-06-Why-I-DevRel %}).  The speaker bio I usually use is:

> Matthew is a (somewhat) functional programmer who enjoys all kinds of language nerdery as well.
>
> He currently works on open-source code at Oracle, helping to make Java in the cloud be as good as it can. If not there, you might find him at a local meetup, teaching kids to code, or away from computers hiking and running in Southwest England.
> 
> Past lives include OpenStacking, teaching English to highschoolers and a whole lot of Clojure and Java.

If that isn't suitable then I'm sure we can come to an agreement about some other words. Here are a few of my talks:
